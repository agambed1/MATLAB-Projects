c = zeros(n-2,1);                           % Vector c

% Define the vectors a and c
for i = 1:(n-2)                                  % Loop from 1 to n-2
    a(i+2) = A(i+2,i);                        % Def. a (use A from row 2 on)

% Compute alpha and beta from LU-factorization of A, and count operations

% Compute g from Lg=f using forward substitution, and count operations

% Compute x from Ux=g using back substitution, and count operations
[x,AS3,MD3] = backSubstitution(beta,c,g);

% Use Matlab to double check if x is the correct solution
